  //"extends": ["//"],

  // ! Note that, topologically, the "root" package is the first dependency of
  // ! all other packages in the repository. Therefore, its scripts, if named
  // ! below, will be run FIRST. This is why the turbo-specific scripts use the
  // ! "turbo:" prefix.

  // * Each of these tasks can be executed by the turbo command. If there are
  // * ANY package.json files with script keys matching the executed task's
  // * name, they will also be run. If a package lists another intra-project
  // * package as a dependency in its package.json, tasks will be run in
  // * topological order (and also with respect to "dependsOn").
  "tasks": {
    // * Will run any matching npm scripts with this task name, but it can also
    // * be a custom task name for which no scripts yet exist.
    "lint": {
      // * If false, this task's outputs will never be cached and this task will
      // * always be rerun; this is useful for powerful tasks like "release".
      //"cache": true,
      // * Whether the task might require interaction from the user. If so, set
      // * this to true (which also requires "cache: false").
      // ! Note that local interactivity is fine, but interactivity should never
      // ! be necessary for a task succeed in an CI/CD scenario.
      //"interactive": false,
      // * These are the NPM SCRIPTS (and not necessarily the "tasks" from this
      // * file) and sub-tasks (defined by turbo.json in sub-roots when this
      // * file is at the project root) that exist in zero or more packages'
      // * package.json that must complete successfully before this task can
      // * execute.
      // *
      // * To target intra-package scripts, just use the scripts' name (e.g.
      // * "build"). To target inter-package scripts in topological order, use
      // * the "^" microsyntax (e.g. "^build"). To target inter-package scripts
      // * arbitrarily, use the "#" microsyntax (e.g. "utils#build"). For tasks
      // * that do not depend on any scripts to execute (that don't already
      // * match the task name), specify an empty array.
      // *
      // * Note that scripts with corresponding tasks marked "persistent"
      // * cannot be targeted by "dependsOn".
      "dependsOn": ["{{turboInitTaskName}}", "^lint"]
      // * "inputs" files will, when changed, cause Turbo to recalculate all
      // * outputs for this task (i.e. force a cache miss). Supports globs and
      // * negation, and paths are relative to the PACKAGE root.
      // ! Note that "inputs" when OMITTED (not just empty) defaults to all
      // ! files in the PACKAGE that are checked into source control. Specifying
      // ! a custom "inputs" field turns this off, meaning it is possible to
      // ! target files that are ignored by git. Instead of this allow-list
      // ! approach, you can use a deny-list approach via "$TURBO_DEFAULT$",
      // ! e.g.: ["$TURBO_DEFAULT$", "!README.md"] (everything but README.md).
      // * For projects using symbiote, "inputs" should usually be defined since
      // * hybridrepo root package are considered an "implicit dependency" of
      // * all other packages in recent versions of Turbo and we need to work
      // * around that. The "lint" task is a notable exception.
      //"inputs": ["$TURBO_DEFAULT$"],
      // * "outputs" files will be returned from the cache. Supports globs and
      // * negation, and paths are relative to the PACKAGE root. An empty
      // * "outputs" field instructs Turbo to only cache logs, which is still
      // * incredibly useful even for "empty" tasks.
      // ! Note that cache directories within output directories should usually
      // ! be negated/excluded, e.g. "!.build/cache/**" or "!.next/cache/**"
      //"outputs": []

      //"env": []
      // * Environment variables that, when changed, should NOT cause Turbo to
      // * recalculate this task's outputs but should still be available to it
      // * anyway.
      // ! BE CAREFUL not to put something here that shouldn't be here. Just
      // ! because a variable is in .env does NOT mean it automatically goes
      // ! here!
