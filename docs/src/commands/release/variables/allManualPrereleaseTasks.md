# Variable: allManualPrereleaseTasks

> `const` **allManualPrereleaseTasks**: `"manual"` = `'manual'`

A string that can be passed to --skip-tasks representing all prerelease tasks
that should be skipped when following "Manual Release Method 2" in
`MAINTAINING.md`.

The skipped tasks are those manageable by an outside scheduler, making this
mode useful when integrating with tools like Turbo.
