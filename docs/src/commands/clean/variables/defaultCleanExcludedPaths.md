# Variable: defaultCleanExcludedPaths

> `const` **defaultCleanExcludedPaths**: `string`[]

Defined in: [src/commands/clean.ts:36](https://github.com/Xunnamius/symbiote/blob/bf93fc6ee8086ef7d92447ad716f3811a334edee/src/commands/clean.ts#L36)

These are the default regular expressions matching paths that are excluded
from deletion when running the "clean" command.

Paths that should only match directories must include a trailing slash. Paths
that should match at any depth (including project root) should be prefixed
with `(^|/)`. Note that periods must be escaped (i.e. `'\\.'`).
